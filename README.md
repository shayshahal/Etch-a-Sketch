# Etch-a-Sketch

this is the Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project's curriculum.

Instead of a popup, the site features a header which takes care of the resizing and clearing. 

What I learned from this project is overall knowledge of html ,css and JS: css variables, regex in JS, usage of vh and vw units, flex and grid manipulation.
